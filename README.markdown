# 64core

Useful C64 development tools for KickAssembler. 
Aiming to be the standard library someday.

Work in Progress.

## Idea

The aim of this library is to make common tasks a bit more easier, but not necessary most efficient.

It is best used at the beginning of the project where you want to just start with something. And later, when your project matures, you can replace 64core routines with optimized ones.

## Installation

### Recommended way

1. Create a dir for libraries that your KickAssembler projects use.
2. Get the current version of the 64core and copy contents of /lib into this dir along with other libraries. 
3. Import it in your files as <code>.import source "64core.asm" or select specific modules</code>
4. Make sure to pass option <code>-libdir <path-to-your-libraries-dir></code> when compiling with KickAssembler.

### If you just want to try it out

1. Get the latest version of the 64core and copy contents of /lib into your project dir.
2. Import it in your any files files as <code>.import source "./64core.asm"</code>

## Existing modules

#### 1. 64core/common

Contains function used by other modules. Currently bit/byte extraction operations.

#### 2. Encoding

Functions for creating characters and strings in screencode or PETSCII encoding.

#### 4. Kernal

Pseudocommands and macros for Kernal routines

#### 5. Math

Multibyte arithmetic and logical operations.

#### 6. Memory

Helper functions for filling and copying data in memory.

#### 7. Version

One function <code>_64core_version()</code> returning current version of the library.
